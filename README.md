## Notes

- Folders are numbered to match the course order.
- **Datasets are not included** in this repository due to course distribution restrictions.
- All notebooks were developed and executed using **Google Colab**.

### Dataset Instructions

If you are running the notebooks in **Google Colab**:

- You must manually upload the required dataset file before running the notebook.
- Most notebooks expect the dataset file to be uploaded into the current Colab working directory.

Since the datasets were provided as part of the course materials, they are not publicly shared in this repository.

If you need any specific dataset used in these notebooks, please feel free to contact me directly.
